# GigHive Content and Copyright Policy

_Last updated: November 2025_

## Overview

GigHive is an **open-source platform** that enables musicians and developers to deploy their own self-hosted environments for managing and sharing original audio, video, and loop content.  
Each GigHive instance operates independently on the owner’s infrastructure and is not centrally managed or controlled by the GigHive project maintainers.

This document provides general guidance to help instance operators and users maintain compliance with copyright law and responsible content management practices.

---

## 1. Copyright and Intellectual Property

All material uploaded to any GigHive instance **must be original** or used with the **explicit permission** of the copyright holder (e.g., the band, composer, or producer).  
By uploading content, users confirm that they:

- Own or are authorized to distribute the material.  
- Are not infringing upon the copyrights, trademarks, or publicity rights of others.  
- Will not upload unauthorized recordings, samples, or remixes without permission.

Each GigHive instance operator is responsible for ensuring that the content hosted on their server complies with applicable copyright laws.  

The GigHive open-source project itself does **not host or control** any user content and has **no ability to remove or moderate** material from independently deployed instances.

---

## 2. Prohibited Content

Operators and users of GigHive instances may not upload, distribute, or store any content that:

- Infringes on another party’s intellectual property rights.  
- Contains illegal, defamatory, or explicit material.  
- Encourages violence, discrimination, or harassment.  
- Includes private or personally identifiable information without consent.

Instance operators are encouraged to implement moderation and review mechanisms to ensure their hosted content aligns with these guidelines.

---

## 3. Reporting Infringing or Inappropriate Content

If you believe that content hosted on a GigHive instance infringes your copyright or violates applicable laws, please contact the **operator of that specific instance** directly.  
Because GigHive is open-source and self-hosted, the GigHive project maintainers do not have access to or control over independently operated servers.

For questions about this policy or to report misuse of the GigHive software (not content hosted on specific servers), you may contact the project maintainers at:

📧 **copyright@gighive.app**

---

## 4. Moderation and Instance Operator Responsibility

Each GigHive instance operator bears full responsibility for moderating content hosted within their environment.  
The GigHive open-source project provides these guidelines as a framework, but does not:

- Review or approve content uploaded to third-party instances.  
- Respond to content removal requests for independently hosted deployments.  
- Intervene in disputes between users or operators.

Instance operators should implement their own moderation workflows, reporting tools, and content policies to remain compliant with applicable laws and platform rules (e.g., App Store or Play Store policies).

---

## 5. Disclaimer

GigHive is a **self-hosted, open-source software project** maintained by independent developers.  
While the project provides moderation tools and recommended practices, **each instance operator is solely responsible for their server, content, and compliance**.  

The GigHive project maintainers do not monitor, manage, or host user content and cannot remove or alter material from independently deployed systems.
