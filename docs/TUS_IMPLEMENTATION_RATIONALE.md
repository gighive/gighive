# TUS Implementation Rationale

## Question: Is it worthwhile to implement TUS protocol for Cloudflare compatibility?

## Recommendation: **Yes, implement TUS** - but with caveats

---

## Rationale for TUS Implementation

### 1. Real-World Usage Pattern
- Users will frequently upload from outside networks (coffee shops, venues, traveling)
- Your target content (wedding videos, band performances) is typically **>100MB**
- From testing: 24-min video = 4.7GB after H.264 transcoding
- Even shorter videos often exceed 100MB (e.g., 10-min 4K video ≈ 2GB)

### 2. Current Limitation is Severe
- **100MB = ~5 minutes of 4K video** at typical bitrates
- Most gig/event videos are 15-60+ minutes
- Without TUS, the app is essentially **broken for remote uploads** of typical content
- Discovered during testing from outside Wi-Fi network

### 3. Technical Feasibility
You already have the hard parts solved:
- ✅ Memory-efficient streaming (`MultipartInputStream`)
- ✅ Progress tracking infrastructure
- ✅ Cancellation handling
- ✅ Clean architecture with `UploadClient` abstraction

TUS is just adding a **routing layer** on top of existing code.

### 4. Low Implementation Risk
- **Fallback strategy**: Files <100MB use existing path (proven to work)
- **New path**: Files >100MB use TUS (new code path)
- If TUS fails, show clear error message
- No risk to existing functionality

## Counter-Arguments (Why You Might NOT Do It)

### 1. Workaround Exists
- Users can upload via local network / direct IP
- Could document: "For large files, connect to venue WiFi"
- Acceptable if this is a niche tool for tech-savvy users

### 2. Server Complexity
- Requires TUS-compatible server endpoint
- Current `uploads.php` won't work as-is
- Need to implement/deploy TUS server (tusd, or PHP TUS library)
- Additional server maintenance burden

### 3. Alternative: Bypass Cloudflare
- Could use separate subdomain without Cloudflare proxy
- E.g., `upload.gighive.app` → direct to server (DNS only)
- Simpler than TUS implementation
- Trade-off: Lose Cloudflare DDoS protection on upload endpoint

### 4. Usage Frequency
- If 90% of uploads happen on local network at venues, TUS adds complexity for edge cases
- Depends on actual usage patterns

---

## Decision Matrix

### Implement TUS if:
- ✅ Users regularly upload remotely (not just at venues)
- ✅ You want a polished, "works everywhere" experience
- ✅ You're willing to set up TUS server infrastructure
- ✅ This is a product you're building for wider use

### Skip TUS if:
- ❌ This is primarily for local network use
- ❌ You can't easily deploy TUS server
- ❌ You're okay with "upload large files on local network only" limitation
- ❌ You prefer the Cloudflare bypass approach (separate upload subdomain)

---

## Recommended Alternative: Cloudflare Bypass

**Easiest solution without TUS:**

1. Create `upload.gighive.app` subdomain
2. Point it directly to your server (DNS only, no Cloudflare proxy)
3. Use this for uploads >100MB
4. Keep main site behind Cloudflare

### Benefits:
- ✅ No 100MB limit
- ✅ No code changes needed
- ✅ Works with existing implementation
- ✅ Simple DNS configuration

### Trade-offs:
- ❌ Lose Cloudflare DDoS protection on upload endpoint
- ✅ But uploads are authenticated anyway (Basic Auth)
- ✅ Upload endpoint is not publicly advertised

---

## Implementation Comparison

### Option 1: TUS Protocol
**Client Changes:**
- Add TUSKit dependency
- Create `TUSUploadClient.swift` (~80 lines)
- Add routing logic in `UploadClient.swift` (~30 lines)
- Update one line in `UploadView.swift`

**Server Changes:**
- Deploy TUS server (tusd or PHP library)
- Configure chunked upload handling
- Update Apache/nginx config

**Complexity:** Medium-High  
**Maintenance:** Ongoing (TUS server)

### Option 2: Cloudflare Bypass
**Client Changes:**
- Add setting toggle for "use direct upload"
- Change base URL conditionally

**Server Changes:**
- Add DNS A record for `upload.gighive.app`
- Point to server IP (no Cloudflare proxy)

**Complexity:** Low  
**Maintenance:** Minimal

### Option 3: Hybrid Approach
**Strategy:**
- Start with Cloudflare bypass (quick win)
- Implement TUS later if needed
- Keep TUS implementation guide ready

**Benefits:**
- Unblocks users immediately
- Defers complexity
- Can evaluate actual need based on usage

## Current State

### What Works:
- ✅ Local network uploads (any size up to 6GB)
- ✅ Remote uploads <100MB through Cloudflare
- ✅ Memory-efficient streaming
- ✅ Real-time progress tracking
- ✅ Cancellation support

### What Fails:
- ❌ Remote uploads >100MB through Cloudflare (HTTP 413)

### Test Results:
- 177MB video: ❌ Failed (Cloudflare 413)
- 241MB video: ❌ Failed (Cloudflare 413)
- 350MB video: ❌ Failed (Cloudflare 413)
- 4.7GB video: ✅ Works on local network

## Recommendation Summary

**Short-term (Immediate):**
Implement **Cloudflare Bypass** approach:
- Fastest to deploy
- Unblocks remote uploads immediately
- No code changes required
- Minimal risk

**Long-term (If needed):**
Implement **TUS Protocol** if:
- User feedback indicates frequent remote uploads
- You want enterprise-grade reliability
- You're building this as a commercial product
- You have resources for server infrastructure

**Pragmatic Approach:**
1. Deploy Cloudflare bypass now (1 hour)
2. Monitor usage patterns for 1-2 months
3. Decide on TUS based on actual data
4. Keep TUS implementation guide ready for when needed
