<div class="custom-h1">Welcome to GigHive!</div>
<div class="custom-h2">Gighive is a media database for you, your fans, or wedding guests.</div>
### If you're a musician
- You can use it as a library of your bands sessions, audio and video files.
- Have your fans upload videos from your gigs and utilize the footage from every conceivable angle.

### If you're a wedding photographer
- You can have your guests upload audio and video files from a wedding that you can incorporate into a compilation video.
- Collect media from everyone during the event, offload it and then spin down the compute instance after you're done, thus saving you money.

### If you are a media librarian or have a preexisting cache of media files
- You can edit the default csv file to create your own historical Gighive.

### Why not just use YouTube?
- This site is for do-it-yourselfers who don't want to be beholden to Big Tech but be the masters of their own destiny.
- With build targets such as Azure, virtualbox or bare metal, you have your choice on how to deploy Gighive.
- Gighive frees you from content limitations on the major providers..but you'll need to size your vm properly.
- It is secure [by default](SECURITY.html) and was built from the ground up to live behind the [Cloudflare shield](https://www.cloudflare.com).
- Gighive is simple. There is one page for the media library and one upload page or easy-to-use iphone app..that's all.

### Requirements
1. Control Machine: Tested on Ubuntu 22.04, so the requirements are **any flavor of Ubuntu 22.04 or Pop-OS, installed on bare metal.**
2. Target Machine: Your choice of virtualbox, Azure or bare metal deployment targets for the vm and containerized environment.
These are shown in this <a href="images/architecture.png">architecture diagram</a>.

### What do I get with Gighive?
- Gighive includes a website with a searchable, sortable one-page listing of media files and common attributes (date, filename, etc) stored [in the database](images/databaseErd.png) along with an [upload utility](images/uploadutility.png).
- Common media formats for upload are supported (shown below).
- [Here are instructions](README.html) on how to standup and manage your own Gighive.

### Media formats supported
- Audio formats: MP3 (audio/mpeg, audio/mp3), WAV (audio/wav, audio/x-wav), AAC (audio/aac), FLAC (audio/flac), MP4 Audio (audio/mp4)
- Video formats: MP4 (video/mp4), QuickTime/MOV (video/quicktime), Matroska/MKV (video/x-matroska), WebM (video/webm), AVI (video/x-msvideo)
- Note that .MOV and .AVI don't autoplay in the browser

### For the future
- Eventually, we will develop more interesting features. But for now, we've keeping it simple and easy to manage.

### So give Gighive a try! For those with a bit of unix and command line experience, it will be a breeze to setup!
