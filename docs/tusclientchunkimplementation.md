# Chunked Upload Implementation for GigHive iOS Client

## Overview

This document outlines the implementation plan for adding chunked upload capability to the GigHive iOS client to improve handling of large video files.

## Current Implementation Issues

The current `UploadClient` has a significant problem for large files:
```swift
let fileData = try Data(contentsOf: payload.fileURL)  // Loads ENTIRE file into memory!
```

This loads the entire video file into memory at once, which can cause:
- Memory pressure/crashes with large files (GB+ videos)
- Poor user experience during upload
- No ability to resume failed uploads

## Proposed Chunked Upload Solution

Implement a chunked upload system with these benefits:
- **Memory efficient**: Only load small chunks (e.g., 1MB) at a time
- **Resumable**: Continue from where it left off if interrupted
- **Better progress tracking**: More granular progress updates
- **Fault tolerant**: Retry individual chunks on failure

## Implementation Approach

### Client-Side Changes (Moderate Work)
1. **New chunked upload method** in `UploadClient`
2. **Chunk management**: Split file into chunks, track progress
3. **Resume logic**: Store/retrieve upload state
4. **Retry mechanism**: Handle individual chunk failures

### Server-Side Changes (Minimal Work)
The current server can likely handle chunked uploads with minor modifications:
1. **New endpoint**: `/api/uploads/chunked` for chunk uploads
2. **Chunk assembly**: Reassemble chunks into final file
3. **Metadata handling**: Store upload session info

## Implementation Details

### Chunked Upload Features
- Maintains backward compatibility with current uploads
- Adds chunked upload as an option (maybe for files > 50MB)
- Includes resumable upload capability
- Provides better progress feedback

### Work Breakdown
- **Client modifications**: ~200-300 lines of Swift code
- **Server additions**: ~100-150 lines of PHP code
- **Testing**: Ensure both methods work reliably

## Benefits

1. **Improved Memory Usage**: No more loading entire files into memory
2. **Better User Experience**: More responsive app, better progress indication
3. **Reliability**: Ability to resume interrupted uploads
4. **Scalability**: Handle much larger video files without crashes

## Next Steps

1. Implement chunked upload client modifications
2. Add server-side chunked upload endpoint
3. Add resumable upload state management
4. Test with various file sizes and network conditions
5. Add configuration options for chunk size and retry logic
