What is Gighive?
- It started as a replacement for my band's website.  (show StormPigs)
- at it's core, Gighive is a web-accessible database of media files, mainly for bands. (show the database)
- As I was developing the software, I thought it might be a nice feature to include an app to allow fans of the band to upload video files (show app upload feature)
- Since the core feature is a database, I then thought Gighive could be used as a library of media files for people who have collected tons of content over the years, so I built an upload capability that first scans a directory of files and then in a second step, uploads them to the gighive server.  (show the admin.php and that process).

- The server itself could be a machine you have, but I recommend buying an Orange or Raspberry Pi or little Intel mini PC, stuffing a 1TB NVMe in it and install the latest Ubuntu or Pop-OS on it to use as the media server. (show little boxes and command line)
- You'd then use the Gighive ansible scripts to install the prerequisites (docker, python3, etc), as well as the application itself (apache web server and mysql containers running on docker). (show the scripts and docker ps output)

- Gighive has a ton of versatility, but it's made for a person who has some skill with PCs and knowledge of the Unix command line. (show box and command line)
