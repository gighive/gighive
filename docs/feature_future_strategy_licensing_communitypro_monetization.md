# GigHive Future Strategy Discussion Plan

## Licensing, Community vs Pro, and Monetization

------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Purpose of This Document

This document scopes and rationalizes three strategic areas for future
discussion:

1.  Licensing Strategy
2.  Community vs Pro Model
3.  Monetization Pathways

The goal is not to make decisions immediately, but to define structured
discussion tracks that can guide future evolution of GigHive in a
deliberate and strategic way.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

# 1. Licensing Strategy

## Objective

Clarify how open GigHive should remain, and what licensing model best
supports long-term sustainability.

## Key Questions for Discussion

-   Should GigHive remain fully permissive (e.g., MIT-style) to maximize
    adoption?
-   Should a copyleft license (e.g., GPL-style) be considered to prevent
    proprietary forks?
-   Should dual-licensing be introduced later?
-   Should core remain open while extensions/plugins are licensed
    differently?

## Strategic Considerations

-   Target audience (technically inclined musicians vs enterprises)
-   Risk of commercial forks
-   Desire for ecosystem contributions
-   Long-term control vs viral adoption

## Deliverable from Future Discussion

-   Clear licensing philosophy statement
-   Selected license model
-   Contribution guidelines aligned with license

------------------------------------------------------------------------

# 2. Community vs Pro Model

## Objective

Define whether GigHive should remain a single open distribution or
evolve into a tiered offering.

## Model Options to Explore

### Option A: Pure Open Source

-   All features free
-   Revenue via support/services only

### Option B: Open Core Model

-   Core platform open source
-   Advanced features available in Pro edition

### Option C: Feature-Based Tiering

-   Community: Basic jam/session hosting
-   Pro: Advanced analytics, API enhancements, automation tools

## Possible Pro Differentiators

-   Advanced API features
-   Enhanced metadata management
-   Multi-user authentication and roles
-   Automated deployment tools
-   Cloud-native packaged builds
-   Performance optimizations
-   Enterprise-grade logging and observability

## Strategic Considerations

-   Avoid alienating early adopters
-   Maintain goodwill in open source community
-   Preserve architectural elegance
-   Avoid premature product fragmentation

## Deliverable from Future Discussion

-   Clear definition of what always remains open
-   Boundaries of Pro features
-   Versioning and packaging strategy

------------------------------------------------------------------------

# 3. Monetization Pathways

## Objective

Identify sustainable revenue models aligned with the GigHive vision.

## Potential Revenue Streams

### 1. Paid Support

-   White-label deployments

### 5. Marketplace Extensions (Future Phase)

-   Paid plugins

-   Integration modules

## Strategic Considerations

-   Avoid heavy operational burden early
-   Maintain technical credibility
-   Keep product simple
-   Protect founder focus and time

## Deliverable from Future Discussion

-   Phased monetization roadmap
-   Revenue validation experiments
-   Clear go-to-market messaging

------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Phased Strategy Discussion Roadmap

## Phase 1 -- Stabilize Core

-   Finalize installation UX (tarball + quick install)
-   Clarify documentation
-   Prepare GitHub for public-facing presentation

## Phase 2 -- Formalize Licensing

-   Select license
-   Define contributor agreement
-   Establish governance model

## Phase 3 -- Define Pro Boundaries

-   Identify candidate advanced features
-   Ensure architectural separation between core and extensions

## Phase 4 -- Test Monetization

-   Offer paid support experimentally
-   Gauge interest in hosted version
-   Measure community growth

------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Closing Thought

GigHive's strength is architectural integrity combined with real
musician usability.

The future strategy discussion should preserve: - Simplicity of
installation - Technical credibility - Community trust - Long-term
optionality

This document serves as a structured agenda for those future strategic
decisions.
