Now the situation is currently this: there will not be files on the server at the time that i run this.  so we won't get any file information from ffprobe to populate into the database.  at the current stage we are at in the development of Section 4, it is my intent to make sure what options we have for the user to load the files in a new, not yet developed step where we identify the directory structure that the user can use to upload files.  so right now, we are just testing that the database gets the files and has a reference to the current directory structure that exists on the user's source machine where he/she is getting his media files from.  the intent will be to make the upload as easy and painless for the user.  I am imagining two options for the user: copy all his/her files one single directory for video files, one single directory for audio files (the media_search_dirs) OR the user copies over his files using his current directory structure with the correct relative directory structure into the media_search_dirs.
