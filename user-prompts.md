- 2025-09-26T16:26:44-04:00
  - i just want to make sure the changes you made are compatible with my default baseline of iphone 12 users. is that right?

- 2025-09-26T16:28:58-04:00
  - got a few errors:

- 2025-09-26T16:31:52-04:00
  - looks like build still failed with same errors i provided in screen capture

- 2025-09-26T16:37:40-04:00
  - ok, app built without errors. but the app is only utilizing a condensed portion of the available screen size. please fix

- 2025-09-26T16:42:21-04:00
  - I stopped the app from running on the iphone, cleared the build folder and reran the build but app still only uses a portion of the screen and not the whole thing

- 2025-09-26T16:44:33-04:00
  - No, not full screen yet

- 2025-09-26T16:55:47-04:00
  - i saw a few warnings appear. 2) the app didn't automatically load into my iphone

- 2025-09-26T16:56:53-04:00
  - what does the slider icon look like?

- 2025-09-26T16:58:24-04:00
  - ok i did that

- 2025-09-26T16:59:29-04:00
  - do i build again or just run?

- 2025-09-26T17:02:14-04:00
  - almost there, but now it is beyond the safe zone, look at attached pic

- 2025-09-26T17:05:05-04:00
  - great! that fixed it! i still don't like the fact that the keyboard is not the usual one, but i can live with this

- 2025-09-26T20:08:41-04:00
  - as part of the "button pressed > contacting server" status checks after the upload button is tapped, can we add a text based percent uploaded indicator? ... i want the percent indicator to appear like 10%.., 20%.. etc ... is it possible to do that?

- 2025-09-26T20:16:36-04:00
  - in xcode, i ran apple-R to run the code. i do not see the change. should i have done something different?

- 2025-09-26T20:19:25-04:00
  - it gave me no % indication at all. at a minimum, i need to see at least 0% and 100%.

- 2025-09-26T20:21:45-04:00
  - got a couple errors. please remember to code for iphone 12 as bare minimum for largest audience

- 2025-09-26T20:29:17-04:00
  - i ran apple-B for a new build, but got this error:

- 2025-09-26T20:30:42-04:00
  - You have access to ios/GigHive/Sources/App/UploadClient.swift please check

- 2025-09-26T20:35:17-04:00
  - is the chunked upload method a commonly used pattern?

- 2025-09-26T20:38:23-04:00
  - two errors:

- 2025-09-26T20:42:59-04:00
  - got a bunch of errors with this latest update

- 2025-09-26T20:46:41-04:00
  - one error

- 2025-09-26T20:49:12-04:00
  - please edit and save the files in order to fix the error in the attached picture

- 2025-09-26T20:53:05-04:00
  - line 145 has nothing in it, which is why it is showing expected declaration. please fix

- 2025-09-26T21:20:08-04:00
  - restore a clean, working version of UploadClient without the progress meter so you can build immediately. that's option a

- 2025-09-26T21:24:55-04:00
  - got minor error, pls fix

- 2025-09-26T21:28:01-04:00
  - got these errors:

- 2025-09-26T21:32:39-04:00
  - i see from the middle window that we're missing a closing brace at position 1 of the last line in UploadClient.swift.  if you see that too, please fix it

- 2025-09-26T21:35:41-04:00
  - got this error:

- 2025-09-26T21:37:37-04:00
  - error on line 145

- 2025-09-26T21:42:41-04:00
  - error on build:

- 2025-09-26T21:50:12-04:00
  - please modify uploadview to swap client.upload with the let statement

- 2025-09-26T22:33:57-04:00
  - in the iphone upload app shown, if i cancel an upload it really doesn't cancel it but just finishes the upload. let's  move to a chunked method of upload.  is that possible?  if so, please lay out a plan for implementation, but don't implement just yet.

- 2025-09-26T22:35:17-04:00
  - Before getting into the technical details, can you just give me the benefits and drawbacks of both options?

- 2025-09-26T22:37:32-04:00
  - are both these options overkill for my gighive app or is it beneficial as the upload portion of the app (which will be very important to my users) is probably one of the big selling points of the app..smooth and reliable uploads.

- 2025-09-27T07:43:25-04:00
  - please save this place to /docs/tusimplementation.md

- 2025-09-27T07:45:02-04:00
  - please create a dated, timestamped log of all my prompts to you in the gighive root directory

- 2025-09-27T07:46:40-04:00
  - a single file with dated/timestamped entries for each prompt will be fine

- 2025-09-27T07:52:53-04:00
  - add the date and timestamp and content of all the  prompts from this conversation into user-prompts.md

- 2025-09-27T07:54:47-04:00
  - add the date and timestamp and content of all the prompts from this conversation into user-prompts.md

- 2025-09-27T08:08:37-04:00
  - in the iphone app, what does Choose File actually do to prep the file for upload?  does it copy the media file to a temp file in preparation for the upload?  I ask because I notice that it takes time.

- 2025-09-27T08:11:16-04:00
  - ok, i understand about the local temp file copy.  for the second part, the actual upload can we modify uploadclient to use a chunked method of uploading?  would that be a lot of work?

- 2025-09-27T08:13:07-04:00
  - copy these high level steps into /docs/tusclientchunkimplementation.md

- 2025-09-27T08:14:38-04:00
  - have you been adding each of my prompts into user-prompts.md as we go along or do you expect me to ask you to add them at various intervals during the day?

- 2025-09-27T08:15:48-04:00
  - please setup a system where you automatically add new prompts at the end of each of our exchanges.

- 2025-09-27T08:16:50-04:00
  - please resort the file so that older prompts are at the top and newer prompts are at the bottom

- 2025-09-27T08:19:48-04:00
  - i know that my apache implementation sends media files in chunks, but what is the best way to check if it accepts media uploads in chunks?  can you check dev.stormpigs.com (a server available in the interrnet) for appropriate headers?

- 2025-09-27T08:25:19-04:00
  - 1) please put all of the tests that you just performed into /docs/testApacheHeaders.md and 2) can you create phpinfo.php in ~/scripts/gighive/ansible/roles/docker/files/apache/webroot/debug and then i will test?

- 2025-09-27T08:33:45-04:00
  - here is the output of phpinfo.php: sodo@pop-os:~/scripts/gighive$ curl -u "uploader:secretuploader" https://dev.stormpigs.com/phpinfo.php [followed by full phpinfo HTML output]

- 2025-09-27T08:36:10-04:00
  - 1) please post the results of your chunked file analysis in the file /docs/chunkedfileconfiguration.md 2) i have removed user-prompts.md from .gitignore so that you can update the file with this prompt and the preceding one.

- 2025-09-27T08:38:00-04:00
  - is there any downside to raising memory limit of chunked uploads to 512M ?

- 2025-09-27T08:39:49-04:00
  - i see there is a /home/sodo/scripts/gighive/ansible/roles/docker/files/apache/externalConfigs/php-fpm.conf file..is that where we would add the memory_limit?

- 2025-09-27T08:41:20-04:00
  - oh, i see this file: /home/sodo/scripts/gighive/ansible/roles/docker/files/apache/externalConfigs/www.conf, that should be a good place, yes?

- 2025-09-27T08:51:57-04:00
  - ok, given this information, how does this change our plan laid out in tusclientchunkimplementation.md?

- 2025-09-27T08:55:24-04:00
  - 1) let's go with the next steps you laid out, but provide a detail plan for implementation first 2) update tusclientchunkimplementation.md with the plan you laid out 3) let's discuss the plan

- 2025-09-27T08:58:49-04:00
  - Answers: i assume video uploads up to 4GB in size so let's base configuration off that, as well as the capacity of the apache container given what we know about it's configuration.

- 2025-09-27T09:00:26-04:00
  - if you haven't already, please add your optimization summary to tusclientchunkimplementation.md

- 2025-09-27T09:01:45-04:00
  - ok, now what client side code do we need to change to enable this?  what is the plan for that (do not make any changes).

- 2025-09-27T09:06:16-04:00
  - please update the file /docs/tusimplementation.md with this information.

- 2025-09-27T09:08:50-04:00
  - let's review the Week 1: Foundation (TUS integration) changes needed

- 2025-09-27T09:12:13-04:00
  - 1) please add this information to /docs/tusimplementationweek1.md, 2) let's implement these changes

- 2025-09-27T09:17:18-04:00
  - oh hang on, i ran xcodegen from my macbook.  you are pointed at the linux server where the files reside.  so you can skip this step, i did it: macbook2025:GigHive sodo$ xcodegen generate

  - got a build fail:

- 2025-09-27T09:23:38-04:00
  - do i need to run xcodegen or can i just clean the build folder and do apple-B?

- 2025-09-27T09:25:15-04:00

- 2025-09-27T09:32:50-04:00
  - ok, build worked.  but now we're back to the issue where the app doesn't take up the full screen and doesn't go edge to edge on iphone 12.  i see we have Is Initial View Controller selected, but how do we fix the edge to edge issue?

- 2025-09-27T09:39:47-04:00
  - ok basic upload worked.  to the debug text, i'd like to add the file size of the file being uploaded.  can we put that in the red debug text between "button pressed" and "contacting server" ?

- 2025-09-27T09:46:58-04:00
  - right now, we have two methods of uploading: non-chunked for files < 100MB or chunked for > 100MB.  for better user experience when needing to cancel an upload, shouldn't we default to chunked for all uploads?

- 2025-09-27T09:51:00-04:00
  - the last set of changes broke the "disable certificate checking" radio button, because even tho i have it selected, i get the debug message "you might be connecting to a server that is pretending" ...

- 2025-09-27T09:52:38-04:00
  - got error:

- 2025-09-27T09:59:03-04:00
  - when i select the media file, it currently says "loading media".  what i would like to add is after it loads the media, that a label appears right where "loading media" appeared that shows the file size of the loaded media. the text will stick around until the media is fully uploaded or cancelled.  again, this text will appear in that small red debug text.

- 2025-09-27T10:07:02-04:00
  - the file size indicator shows.  great.  now after i press the upload button to cancel, the button shows "Cancelling" but never resets the text of the button to "Upload" again after the cancellation takes place.  the button text should not revert to "Upload" again until we truly verify that the file upload has been cancelled, and not just because we pressed the button.  can you fix this?

- 2025-09-27T10:13:15-04:00
  - also, i notice after a file get cancelled, that the media file is still selected.  that field should reset as well.

- 2025-09-27T10:14:38-04:00
  - got error:

- 2025-09-27T10:17:45-04:00
  - Add this to "Loading media.." debug text: "please wait until media is uploaded and you see it's file size."

- 2025-09-27T10:20:43-04:00
  - i think something is wrong with the progress meter logic..the progress meter logic should be based on the statistics of the http upload.  but i observe when I'm on a celluar connection that for a 245MB file, that the progress meter indicates an almost instantaneous upload.  we need to fix the progress meter to actually calculate the real bytes uploaded by looking at the network stream.  1) are you aware that the progress meter is deficient in this way? 2) if so, let's fix this.

- 2025-09-27T10:26:14-04:00
  - go ahead and clean up the code

- 2025-09-27T10:29:11-04:00
  - got a build error:

- 2025-09-27T10:30:43-04:00
  - got errors.  first two are same as before, but errors 3/4 are new:

- 2025-09-27T10:50:29-04:00
  - a few issues:

- 2025-09-27T10:52:48-04:00
  - hang on, the screen size defaulted to not being edge to edge again..

- 2025-09-27T10:53:58-04:00
  - how can we stop this from happening?

- 2025-09-27T10:55:25-04:00
  - i guess i need to run xcodegen generate and the rebuild now, yes?

- 2025-09-27T10:58:57-04:00
  - the progress meter text (10%..20%..etc) is not showing in the debug area under the Upload button

- 2025-09-27T11:01:28-04:00
  - start with 0% uploaded immediately so that the user know that there is a progress meter forthcoming..

- 2025-09-27T11:04:07-04:00
  - after a successful or cancelled upload, please clear the debug area below the upload button AFTER a user selects a new file so that the user does not get confused by seeing the old debug text.

- 2025-09-27T11:10:04-04:00
  - interesting..when i hit cancel, the progress meter continued after 40% when i hit cancel until the file was loaded successfully.  is the cancel button taking advantage of the fact that we are doing chunked uploads?

- 2025-09-27T11:12:53-04:00
  - Continue

- 2025-09-27T11:15:15-04:00
  - build failed here:

- 2025-09-27T11:18:56-04:00
  - slight timing issue..when I select "Choose File", the "Loading media.." text immediately appears, even tho I haven't selected a file yet.  Please fix this so that text only appears AFTER i have selected a file.  Also, remove the space between "Loading media... " and "please wait until media is uploaded and you see it's file size."

- 2025-09-27T11:21:30-04:00
  - ooops..something went wrong because I now do not see Loading media notification at all after choosing a file!

- 2025-09-27T11:23:30-04:00
  - no still same issue, but this time, i see the Loading Media flash for a microsecond before it disappears.  Loading media text needs to display the entire time the file is being loaded into memory.

- 2025-09-27T11:25:42-04:00
  - no, still same issue.. i see the Loading Media flash for a microsecond before it disappears.  Loading media text needs to be immediately seen after I choose the file, until the file is fully loaded  into memory.

- 2025-09-27T11:27:13-04:00
  - no, still same issue!

- 2025-09-27T11:32:35-04:00
  - i cleaned build then rebuilt, but do not see that debug text.  in any case, i see this as a relatively simple task.  flow is: i press "Choose File", the picker appears, and I select the media file.  Right after I select the media file, picker disappears and the Loading media message appears until the file is copied to memory, after which the app displays File size notification.  this is sequential in nature, so I don't understand why we need any complex logic to fix this.  am i missing something?

- 2025-09-27T11:35:45-04:00
  - still same issue, i don't see the Loading media message until right before the File size indicator.  so Loading media seems to be in the wrong position in the sequence flow that I outlined.  please review and fix

- 2025-09-27T11:38:32-04:00
  - issue still is present..i don't see the Loading media message until right before the File size indicator.  so Loading media seems to be in the wrong position in the sequence flow that I outlined.  please review and fix

- 2025-09-27T11:49:02-04:00
  - can we strip down the Loading Media logic to bare bones?  i don't want any complex logic.  give me a plan for implementation. but don't make any changes.  just the plan

- 2025-09-27T11:51:51-04:00
  - i don't understand why we need a fixed delay.

- 2025-09-27T11:55:54-04:00
  - how about this change: // After file selected:
1. Calculate size 2. Set isLoadingMedia = true and display Loading media <filesize>
3. Start actual file processing (memory access)
3. When processing completes → Notification that file loaded with file size, clear loading

- 2025-09-27T12:00:06-04:00
  - still only seeing the Loading media message flash after the file is loaded into memory.  let's review the logic again.  please list out the sequence of steps and let's review

- 2025-09-27T12:00:55-04:00
  - yes and if it fails again, let's review the logic again

- 2025-09-27T12:02:20-04:00
  - in that 6 step sequence, where is the initial calculation of the file size happening?

- 2025-09-27T12:04:29-04:00
  - ok, so it's at step 6 that loading happens..the previous steps are calculations, messaging, setting flags.  i think this looks right

- 2025-09-27T12:07:48-04:00
  - something is still wrong because that Loading media.. message only comes directly before the media is loaded into memory and then the file size notification pops up.  so we need to debug why the Loading media message is not being immediately displayed after the picker disappears.  can we add debugging to show us what's happening?

- 2025-09-27T12:09:51-04:00
  - will we see the steps numbered as in the list above so it's easy to tell where we are ?

- 2025-09-27T12:10:57-04:00
  - when you say console output, where is that console output appearing?  in xcode or in the app?

- 2025-09-27T12:13:27-04:00
  - i cleared build directory and rebuilt/ran, but don't see any output in the console window:

- 2025-09-27T12:17:13-04:00
  - still don't see anything am i in the right place in xcode?

- 2025-09-27T12:18:34-04:00
  - this area, correct?

- 2025-09-27T12:21:35-04:00
  - information does not appear in the debug window for either the simulator or the iphone.  what can i do to resolve this?  what was that test you gave me earlier?

- 2025-09-27T12:25:22-04:00
  - No TEST message appears in the simulator.  I checked the build config and it is set to debug, so no problem there.  for #2, i changed from auto to all and then touched the media file box in the app..did not output to the debug window

- 2025-09-27T12:31:55-04:00
  - OK this is interesting, i chose a large file 249MB.  The debug messages at the bottom of the screen below the upload button did not appear until that file was fully loaded!  so something tells me there is some global variable that is preventing the labels from firing when we want them to.  the debug messages being held back from display is the key.  there may be some special behavior a global setting is inhibiting

- 2025-09-27T12:33:48-04:00
  - the issue still persists..something is getting queued up and blocking the display of the debug messages..

- 2025-09-27T12:36:52-04:00
  - i cleaned project folder, rebuilt/reran, but still the issue persists..i don't see debug text until after file loaded

- 2025-09-27T12:38:06-04:00
  - hold on, maybe i misunderstood, should i rebuild/rerun the app and then just sit and wait for your timers to do their thing?

- 2025-09-27T12:40:50-04:00
  - i believe there is something wrong with your debug code, because the load messages have real file sizes..so your fake out is not working

- 2025-09-27T12:43:47-04:00
  - ok i tested..debug messages still don't appear until the end

- 2025-09-27T12:47:07-04:00
  - excellent! now the debug messages appear immediately and the loading media message appears and stays for 3 seconds.  so the issue was the picker callback was blocking the UI updates.  now let's put back the real file loading logic but keep it outside the picker callback using the onChange approach

  - after selecting a media file, the loading messages and debug messages appeared at the same time.  Loading message stayed for 3 seconds.  Then File size says FAKE 300 MB.

- 2025-09-27T12:56:50-04:00
  - OK, i like the debug messages that appear below the Upload after the file is loaded into memory are good.  and i see the real file size now.  however, the issue that the Loading media message only flashes for a second after the file is loaded into memory and then gets superceded by the File Size indicator.  So the issue still persists.  Just need the Loading media message..maybe let's just use the lame method of displaying the "loading media" message right after we click the button under Media File selection box in the UI.  unless you have better ideas?

- 2025-09-27T13:00:04-04:00
  - well, i see that the loading message appears a little bit longer due to your additional .2 seconds, but again, this is lipstick on a pig because the real issue is that the Loading media message is being constrained from being displayed until the media loads, just like the debug messages are being constrained

- 2025-09-27T13:02:43-04:00
  - got a bunch of errors probably related to same expected declaration

- 2025-09-27T13:04:29-04:00
  - issues persist:

- 2025-09-27T13:07:33-04:00
  - do you have access to a working UploadView.swift previous to all these issues?  I'd rather just rollback

- 2025-09-27T13:10:03-04:00
  - i'm wondering if something got corrupted in xcode, because xcode is reporting those errors even after i clean the build directory and rebuilt

- 2025-09-27T13:11:11-04:00
  - i should just clean the build directory and rebuild .. no other steps, correct?

- 2025-09-27T13:22:09-04:00
  - ok, i rolled back to a working version of UploadView.swift from my git repo.  Let's integrate two changes that have value.  1) Please add those debug messages while loading that appear below the Upload button.  2) Also, add the "Loading Media" message to be displayed right after I touch the Media File selector.  This was the old version of the feature if you recall.

- 2025-09-27T13:24:52-04:00
  - No, the "Loading media" message should load right after i touch the Media File dropdown.  Currently, Loading media doesn't appear until the file selected is placed into memory

- 2025-09-27T13:29:01-04:00
  - The second issue was that you helped me add debug code that appeared below the upload button that gave us a summary of what was happening during the loading of the file into the iphone memory.  do you remember?

- 2025-09-27T13:31:26-04:00
  - yes, i understand it is working in the instance where we have pressed the upload button.  but what i am referring to was additional debugging for the loading of the chosen file into the iphone memory (unrelated to upload being pressed), but was displayed under the upload button.  do you recall that additional debugging for the file loading into memory that appeared under the upload button?

- 2025-09-27T13:32:29-04:00
  - Yes!

- 2025-09-27T13:37:13-04:00
  - can you display a message if any of the mandatory fields (marked with an *) in the gui aren't filled out?

- 2025-09-27T13:40:48-04:00
  - After a successful upload, please preprend UPLOAD SUCCESSFUL! in the debug message block, one line above the regular debug output

- 2025-09-27T13:50:57-04:00
  - i'd like to run two versions of db/database.php.  One that is the full version that shows all the fields.  Secondly, a simplified version where Rating, Keywords, Location, Summary and Crew are removed.  My intent is to use the simple version with the gighive app_flavor specified in inventories/group_vars, and the more complex with the stormpigs app_flavor version.  Give me a plan to accomplish this.

- 2025-09-27T13:55:23-04:00
  - for #2 we will do the reverse logic.  stormpigs is the base app_flavor and we overlay with gighive files as below.  so please adjust your instructions based on this information: sodo@pop-os:~/scripts/gighive/ansible/roles/docker/files/apache/overlays/gighive$ ll

  - ok please convert /docs/index.html to /docs/index.md

- 2025-09-30T12:11:12-04:00
  - do you see common elements between index.md and README.md files?

- 2025-09-30T12:13:26-04:00
  - ok, is there a better way to design index.md and README.md to pull out the common elements into a COMMON.md and then insert COMMON.md inside both files?  Does markdown have the ability to do that?  If so , create a plan to do this, but don't do it yet until I review the plan.

- 2025-09-30T12:15:00-04:00
  - execute the alternative manual approach please, but don't touch index.md and README.md

- 2025-09-30T12:23:07-04:00
  - small problem with index.md..the icon is huge.  can you fix ?

- 2025-09-30T12:29:43-04:00
  - can you convert LICENSE_MIT.md and LICENSE_COMMERCIAL.md to truly markdown?  right now they are text files

- 2025-09-30T12:31:50-04:00
  - i want to link those two files into index.md.  So place this text in the same format as the "How do I get started?" section, but put it at the very bottom of index.md.  you will link the MIT license and commercial license titles to the each of the two files that you just edited  ## License

  - if you look at https://gighive.app, that page is a markdown file. Does markdown have the ability to put a little hamburger in the upper right hand corner that you could click and see a list of all the other markdown files would be listed so that people could learn about the gighive software?

- 2025-10-08T17:01:05-04:00
  - hmmm..i loaded the new home page and no clicks register. Also, when I open up the hamburger, the menu that opens is dark like it is offlimits to interact with.

- 2025-10-08T17:09:18-04:00
  - Remove maintenance.md from the hamburger nav. add a section on streaming and add howdoesstreamingwork* and tusimplementationweek1.html files to it. add a server admin section and add howiswebrootworking.html and featureChangedPasswordspage.html

  - in my database, i am not sure why this single file https://www.stormpigs.com/audio/19971230_2.mp3 is getting associated with the jam session from 2006-08-31, because the source csv does not seem to have that relationship defined. Some background info: 1) the csv that is the source of the data for the mysqlserver database lives here: /home/sodo/scripts/gighive/ansible/roles/docker/files/mysql/dbScripts/loadutilities/database.csv. 2) The python script that outputs the data from the csv to individual files for mysql to import is here: /home/sodo/scripts/gighive/ansible/roles/docker/files/mysql/dbScripts/loadutilities/mysqlPrep_full.py 3) A driver file for that python script to output the files into the correct directory for mysql to import is here: /home/sodo/scripts/gighive/ansible/roles/docker/files/mysql/dbScripts/loadutilities/doAllFull.sh 4) That directory with the individual csvs to import into the mysql tables is here: /home/sodo/scripts/gighive/ansible/roles/docker/files/mysql/externalConfigs/prepped_csvs/full 5) Ansible copies that directory of files from the ansible controller machine to the vm host. 6) when mysql container is rebuilt, mysql's built in database load functions will import those files based upon the location specified in docker-compose here: /home/sodo/scripts/gighive/ansible/roles/docker/templates/docker-compose.yml.j2. 7) the docker-compose jinja template gets rendered to here on the vm host: ~/scripts/gighive/ansible/roles/docker/files

- 2025-01-12T15:35:00-05:00
  - make a backup of the script and then make the appropriate change please

- 2025-01-12T15:40:00-05:00
  - There is a second script in the same directory called mysqlPrep_sample.py. can you 1) examine that 2) make recommendation 3) backup the file and 4) assuming the same fix needs to be applied, make the change

- 2025-01-12T15:43:00-05:00
  - Because what i originally described in the problem statement is a critical part of gighive's architecture (the import of a csv file into the database), can you create a .md file that explains all the steps so that users wanting to know how to import data can learn how to do it? Also, one thing i neglected to mention is that the decision whether to use a full or sample database is controlled by the database_full variable located in group_vars file: /home/sodo/scripts/gighive/ansible/inventories/group_vars/gighive.yml Please add that to the documentation as well. If it helps, add a diagram, flowchart or whatever style visualization is appropriate to the task.

- 2025-01-12T15:46:00-05:00

I don't see the files as changed. here is the directory listings, first from the vm host and then the container itself.  you can see the date of the file on the container is older than the vm host.  I'm not sure why the docker container doesn't have the new files, if i have rebuilt the apache vm. can you investigate why this might be?  my docker ansible role is here: ansible/roles/docker.  here is the comparison of file dates from vm host and guest container: ubuntu@gighive:~/scripts/gighive/ansible/roles/docker/files/apache/webroot/src/Controllers$ ll total 32 drwxr-xr-x  2 ubuntu ubuntu 4096 Sep 22 15:50 ./ drwxr-xr-x 10 ubuntu ubuntu 4096 Sep  6 18:32 ../ -rw-r--r--  1 ubuntu ubuntu 4936 Oct 25 09:27 MediaController.php -rw-r--r--  1 ubuntu ubuntu 6820 Sep  5 10:22 MediaController.php.recent -rw-r--r--  1 ubuntu ubuntu 2463 Sep 22 20:53 RandomController.php -rw-r--r--  1 ubuntu ubuntu 3796 Sep  7 09:49 UploadController.php ubuntu@gighive:~/scripts/gighive/ansible/roles/docker/files/apache/webroot/src/Controllers$ docker exec -it apacheWebServer ls -l /var/www/html/src/Controllers total 20 -rwxr-xr-x 1 www-data www-data 2676 Sep 27 18:00 MediaController.php -rw-r--r-- 1 www-data www-data 6820 Sep  5 14:22 MediaController.php.recent -rw-r--r-- 1 www-data www-data 2463 Sep 23 00:53 RandomController.php -rw-r--r-- 1 www-data www-data 3796 Sep  7 13:49 UploadController.php

  - ok.  now, i noticed that the rebuild of the apachewebserver did not take place because i insptected the files on the vm host and they had the old date (see below) ubuntu@gighive:~/scripts/gighive/ansible/roles/docker/files$ docker exec apacheWebServer ls -la /var/www/html/src/Controllers total 36 drwxr-xr-x 1 www-data www-data 4096 Sep 27 18:00 . drwxr-xr-x 1 www-data www-data 4096 Sep 27 18:00 .. -rwxr-xr-x 1 www-data www-data 2676 Sep 27 18:00 MediaController.php -rw-r--r-- 1 www-data www-data 6820 Sep  5 14:22 MediaController.php.recent -rw-r--r-- 1 www-data www-data 2463 Sep 23 00:53 RandomController.php -rw-r--r-- 1 www-data www-data 3796 Sep  7 13:49 UploadController.php.  I had to manually run my rebuild script in order for the apachewebserver to truly be rebuilt.  this script looks like this: ubuntu@gighive:~/scripts/gighive/ansible/roles/docker/files$ cat rebuildContainers.sh ls -l docker-compose down -v docker-compose build docker-compose up -d echo "Sleep for two minutes" sleep 120 docker logs mysqlServer echo "Done!"  Can you speculate on why the ansible task using the docker-compose.yml.j2 did not rebuild the apachewebserver properly?  don't make any changes, just inform me.

  - should i use the gentle approach or should I always go nuclear?  remember that the ansible script has to run initially when there is no container at all so I have to think about these multiple states.

- 2025-10-25T11:17:00-04:00
  - 1) document this in DOCKER_COMPOSE_BEHAVIOR.md and 2) make the option B change.

  - one thing i did not consider in our update to the docker compose behavior was to account for upgrades to my scripts WITHOUT destroying the mysql volume.  the reason for this would be if i needed to issue a patch to my gighive clients that they would apply via ansible as normal, but the patch should not delete their database.  i think we should 1) add a flag in the site.yml file (something like "keep_db = Y" and 2) the ansible task that builds the compose stack would take advantage of.  do you think that is a good idea or do you have a better option?

- 2025-10-25T11:53:00-04:00
  - i like option A.  I can always use my rebuildContainers.sh if i need to go full nuclear and delete the database.  please list the changes necessary for option A but don't make changes until i review/approve

  - remember that the ansible scripts have to account for two states: 1) new vm host is built and both containers need to be stood up fresh.  2) we need to patch gighive for some reason (maybe security update to apachewebserver or a database schema change to mysqlserver), but apachewebserver and mysqlserver already exist.  Do your updates account for these two states?

- 2025-10-25T12:01:00-04:00
  - Yes.  However, since we've consolidated flags in ansible/playbooks/site.yml, does it make sense to put the rebuild_mysql flag there?

- 2025-10-25T12:06:00-04:00
  - let me correct the approach slightly.  The value of the flag ("rebuild_mysql=true") should be in ansible/group_vars/gighive.yml as well.  does that make sense?

- 2025-10-25T12:08:00-04:00
  - in playbooks/site.yml , do we need the rebuild_mysql var in both places or just under hosts: all?

- 2025-10-25T12:09:00-04:00
  - ok, good!  Now show me the list of changes we are going to make.

- 2025-10-25T12:10:00-04:00
  - please 1) update the file docs/DOCKER_COMPOSE_BEHAVIOR.md with rationale and new method, 2) make the proposed changes

  - do you need to update docs/DOCKER_COMPOSE_BEHAVIOR.md?

- 2025-10-25T12:47:00-04:00
  - the full rebuild of the mysqlserver did not work because I see that the database still had the new entry that I added to it.

- 2025-10-25T12:48:00-04:00
  - hang on..the change we had just made that was just to rebuild the mysqlserver container, but NOT remove the volume, is that correct?

- 2025-10-25T12:52:00-04:00
  - ok, so what if we put a second new flag in group_vars/gighive.yml that docker/tasks/main.yml will take advantage of to blow away the persistent volume and rebuild the mysqlserver container from scratch using the mounts in docker-compose.yml.j2 to allow for the automatic rebuild?  how does that sound?   relevant section of docker-compose.yml.j2: mysqlServer: image: mysql:8.0 container_name: mysqlServer restart: unless-stopped ports: - "3306:3306" env_file: - ./mysql/externalConfigs/.env.mysql volumes: - mysql_data:/var/lib/mysql - "{{ docker_dir }}/mysql/externalConfigs/prepped_csvs/{{ 'full' if database_full | bool else 'sample' }}:/var/lib/mysql-files/" - "{{ docker_dir }}/mysql/externalConfigs/create_music_db.sql:/docker-entrypoint-initdb.d/00-create_music_db.sql" - "{{ docker_dir }}/mysql/externalConfigs/load_and_transform.sql:/docker-entrypoint-initdb.d/01-load_and_transform.sql" - "{{ docker_dir }}/mysql/externalConfigs/z-custommysqld.cnf:/etc/mysql/mysql.conf.d/z-custommysqld.cnf"

  - And would these additions to the ansible task run properly in both states: 1) creating the containers new from scratch as well as 2) rebuilding from existing containers?
  - just insert the following text into the file and provide a link to the actual AGPLv3 license at the bottom: Why AGPL v3 AGPL v3 is open source but protective — it forces reciprocity: If someone modifies and runs this code on a server to offer a hosted service, they must also release their source code under AGPL v3.  You cannot use it to build your own SaaS without sharing back.

  - please swap out the MIT License link at the bottom of /docs/index.md with the new AGPL license file.  Update the sentence after it that starts "Free for personal.." with an appropriate high level statement.

- 2025-10-13T12:04:00-04:00
  - Update this line "Open source with strong copyleft protection - requires sharing modifications when used as a service." to read "Open source, free for personal use with strong copyleft protection for use as a SaaS."

  - please update the MIT link in /home/sodo/scripts/gighive/ansible/roles/docker/files/apache/overlays/gighive/index.php to use our new AGPLv3 file.

  - those two license files should actually be .html files instead of .md files, as markdown will get translated to .html by github.
