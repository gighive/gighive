  - i just want to make sure the changes you made are compatible with my default baseline of iphone 12 users. is that right?

- 2025-09-26T16:28:58-04:00
  - got a few errors:

- 2025-09-26T16:31:52-04:00
  - looks like build still failed with same errors i provided in screen capture

- 2025-09-26T16:37:40-04:00
  - ok, app built without errors. but the app is only utilizing a condensed portion of the available screen size. please fix

- 2025-09-26T16:42:21-04:00
  - I stopped the app from running on the iphone, cleared the build folder and reran the build but app still only uses a portion of the screen and not the whole thing

- 2025-09-26T16:44:33-04:00
  - No, not full screen yet

- 2025-09-26T16:55:47-04:00
  - i saw a few warnings appear. 2) the app didn't automatically load into my iphone

- 2025-09-26T16:56:53-04:00
  - what does the slider icon look like?

- 2025-09-26T16:58:24-04:00
  - ok i did that

- 2025-09-26T16:59:29-04:00
  - do i build again or just run?

- 2025-09-26T17:02:14-04:00
  - almost there, but now it is beyond the safe zone, look at attached pic

- 2025-09-26T17:05:05-04:00
  - great! that fixed it! i still don't like the fact that the keyboard is not the usual one, but i can live with this

- 2025-09-26T20:08:41-04:00
  - as part of the "button pressed > contacting server" status checks after the upload button is tapped, can we add a text based percent uploaded indicator? ... i want the percent indicator to appear like 10%.., 20%.. etc ... is it possible to do that?

- 2025-09-26T20:16:36-04:00
  - in xcode, i ran apple-R to run the code. i do not see the change. should i have done something different?

- 2025-09-26T20:19:25-04:00
  - it gave me no % indication at all. at a minimum, i need to see at least 0% and 100%.

- 2025-09-26T20:21:45-04:00
  - got a couple errors. please remember to code for iphone 12 as bare minimum for largest audience

- 2025-09-26T20:29:17-04:00
  - i ran apple-B for a new build, but got this error:

- 2025-09-26T20:30:42-04:00
  - You have access to ios/GigHive/Sources/App/UploadClient.swift please check

- 2025-09-26T20:35:17-04:00
  - is the chunked upload method a commonly used pattern?

- 2025-09-26T20:38:23-04:00
  - two errors:

- 2025-09-26T20:42:59-04:00

- 2025-09-26T20:46:41-04:00
  - one error

- 2025-09-26T20:49:12-04:00
  - please edit and save the files in order to fix the error in the attached picture

- 2025-09-26T20:53:05-04:00
  - line 145 has nothing in it, which is why it is showing expected declaration. please fix

- 2025-09-26T21:20:08-04:00
  - restore a clean, working version of UploadClient without the progress meter so you can build immediately. that's option a

- 2025-09-26T21:24:55-04:00
  - got minor error, pls fix

- 2025-09-26T21:28:01-04:00
  - got these errors:

- 2025-09-26T21:32:39-04:00
  - i see from the middle window that we're missing a closing brace at position 1 of the last line in UploadClient.swift.  if you see that too, please fix it

- 2025-09-26T21:35:41-04:00
  - got this error:

- 2025-09-26T21:37:37-04:00
  - error on line 145

- 2025-09-26T21:42:41-04:00
  - error on build:

- 2025-09-26T21:50:12-04:00
  - please modify uploadview to swap client.upload with the let statement

- 2025-09-26T22:33:57-04:00
  - in the iphone upload app shown, if i cancel an upload it really doesn't cancel it but just finishes the upload. let's  move to a chunked method of upload.  is that possible?  if so, please lay out a plan for implementation, but don't implement just yet.

- 2025-09-26T22:35:17-04:00
  - Before getting into the technical details, can you just give me the benefits and drawbacks of both options?

- 2025-09-26T22:37:32-04:00
  - are both these options overkill for my gighive app or is it beneficial as the upload portion of the app (which will be very important to my users) is probably one of the big selling points of the app..smooth and reliable uploads.

  - please save this place to /docs/tusimplementation.md

- 2025-09-27T07:45:02-04:00
  - please create a dated, timestamped log of all my prompts to you in the gighive root directory

- 2025-09-27T07:46:40-04:00
  - a single file with dated/timestamped entries for each prompt will be fine

- 2025-09-27T07:52:53-04:00
  - add the date and timestamp and content of all the  prompts from this conversation into user-prompts.md

- 2025-09-27T07:54:47-04:00
  - add the date and timestamp and content of all the prompts from this conversation into user-prompts.md

- 2025-09-27T08:08:37-04:00
  - in the iphone app, what does Choose File actually do to prep the file for upload?  does it copy the media file to a temp file in preparation for the upload?  I ask because I notice that it takes time.

- 2025-09-27T08:11:16-04:00
  - ok, i understand about the local temp file copy.  for the second part, the actual upload can we modify uploadclient to use a chunked method of uploading?  would that be a lot of work?

- 2025-09-27T08:13:07-04:00
  - copy these high level steps into /docs/tusclientchunkimplementation.md

- 2025-09-27T08:14:38-04:00
  - have you been adding each of my prompts into user-prompts.md as we go along or do you expect me to ask you to add them at various intervals during the day?

- 2025-09-27T08:15:48-04:00
  - please setup a system where you automatically add new prompts at the end of each of our exchanges.

- 2025-09-27T08:16:50-04:00
  - please resort the file so that older prompts are at the top and newer prompts are at the bottom

- 2025-09-27T08:19:48-04:00
  - i know that my apache implementation sends media files in chunks, but what is the best way to check if it accepts media uploads in chunks?  can you check dev.stormpigs.com (a server available in the interrnet) for appropriate headers?

- 2025-09-27T08:25:19-04:00
  - 1) please put all of the tests that you just performed into /docs/testApacheHeaders.md and 2) can you create phpinfo.php in ~/scripts/gighive/ansible/roles/docker/files/apache/webroot/debug and then i will test?

- 2025-09-27T08:33:45-04:00
  - here is the output of phpinfo.php: sodo@pop-os:~/scripts/gighive$ curl -u "uploader:secretuploader" https://dev.stormpigs.com/phpinfo.php [followed by full phpinfo HTML output]

- 2025-09-27T08:36:10-04:00
  - 1) please post the results of your chunked file analysis in the file /docs/chunkedfileconfiguration.md 2) i have removed user-prompts.md from .gitignore so that you can update the file with this prompt and the preceding one.

- 2025-09-27T08:38:00-04:00
  - is there any downside to raising memory limit of chunked uploads to 512M ?

- 2025-09-27T08:39:49-04:00
  - i see there is a /home/sodo/scripts/gighive/ansible/roles/docker/files/apache/externalConfigs/php-fpm.conf file..is that where we would add the memory_limit?

- 2025-09-27T08:41:20-04:00
  - oh, i see this file: /home/sodo/scripts/gighive/ansible/roles/docker/files/apache/externalConfigs/www.conf, that should be a good place, yes?

- 2025-09-27T08:51:57-04:00
  - ok, given this information, how does this change our plan laid out in tusclientchunkimplementation.md?

- 2025-09-27T08:55:24-04:00
  - 1) let's go with the next steps you laid out, but provide a detail plan for implementation first 2) update tusclientchunkimplementation.md with the plan you laid out 3) let's discuss the plan

- 2025-09-27T08:58:49-04:00
  - Answers: i assume video uploads up to 4GB in size so let's base configuration off that, as well as the capacity of the apache container given what we know about it's configuration.

- 2025-09-27T09:00:26-04:00
  - if you haven't already, please add your optimization summary to tusclientchunkimplementation.md

- 2025-09-27T09:01:45-04:00
  - ok, now what client side code do we need to change to enable this?  what is the plan for that (do not make any changes).
